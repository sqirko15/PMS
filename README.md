# PMS
Polyclinic Management System 

PMS is a solution for management of polyclinics, created to computerize manual operations in clinics. The main purpose is to digitalize patients’ records, in order to make data retrieval easier and more efficient.  

Every patient can have his/her own profile, including his/her detailed health records. He can also access his/her diagnoses or prescriptions written by his/her doctors. 

Also, every doctor has his/her own profile, from where he can see his/her patients’ records and write new diagnoses or prescriptions for them. 

Every action made by patient or doctor should be authorized by the receptionist, who correlates the activity between patients and doctors. 

Essentially, every patient and everyone in the polyclinic should benefit from this system, which is supposed to make their lives easier, by setting everything in order and removing unnecessary human errors from their daily activities.
